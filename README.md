# Face-Diffusion
Diffusion pretrain script based on "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" and "Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" papers. The model was additionally augmented using attention-baced blocks, training method was improved using flash attention. 

For example fake face diffusion generator was trained on [FFHQ small](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tommykamaz/faces-dataset-small/) dataset.
